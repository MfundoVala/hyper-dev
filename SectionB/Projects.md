## ThreeJS Project

:point_right: [Live Hal's world](https://mfundo.online)

This project is a 3D robot world built using Three.js with the 3D world modeled using Blender. It features a robot named Hal moving around in a 3d dome, with a screen and buttons you can click to view some of my 3d projects. The user can interact with the robot using the screen by sending commands using keyboard arrow keys and changing the robot's direction of movement, the in world screen buttons are clicked using the user's mouse.

The idea for the project came from the projects I completed during the wethinkcode bootcamp, where we iteritively built a terminal Java terminal app with a Robot named Hal moving around in a 2d array world. When I was ahead with my projects I decided to self teach Javascript and Threejs and build a 3D gui version of the project that accepts keyboard and mouse user input as a personal project.

Overall, this project serves as a perfect blend of modern technology and innovative design, showcasing the potential for the future of robotic interactions in 3D environments.

I was given a weekend to complete this challenge. Where I had to learn 2 new languages (php, sql), build an api and a front end to consume the API.

I also opted to do a rough Hi Fidelity UI design due to habit.

This is a Task manager CRUD up that let's you view, edit, create and delete tasks.

This project was built with the help of:

- React: Front end UI
- PHP and MySql: Rest api and backend
- Redux with Redux toolkit: State management
- Redux thunk: Asynchronus API calls
- Redux-persist: State persistence
- Sass: SCSS styling
- react-datepicker: Date picking component
