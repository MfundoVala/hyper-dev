## Intervention Plan for Bootcamp Students

As a mentor, it's essential to ensure all students make progress and complete their bootcamp successfully. In this hypothetical situation, there are 20 part-time students on a 6-month bootcamp. Of this group, 5 students are 2 weeks behind, 10 are at risk of falling behind, and 5 are ahead of expected progress. Here's an intervention plan to get the 5 lagging students back on track while ensuring the 10 at-risk students do not fall behind and the 5 students who are ahead are not negatively impacted:

1. **Meet with the students who are 2 weeks behind:** Schedule a meeting with each of the 5 students to discuss their progress and understand the reason for their lagging progress. Work with them to come up with a plan to catch up. The plan could include one-on-one tutoring, additional resources, or modified timelines to help them get back on track.

2. **Schedule one-on-one meetings with at-risk students:** Identify the 10 students who are at risk of falling behind and schedule one-on-one meetings with them to provide support and encourage them to seek assistance when they face difficulties. Work with them to identify any obstacles that may be hindering their progress, provide additional resources, or extension to help them finish their tasks within the deadline.

3. **Maintain momentum for students ahead of progress:** Ensure the 5 students who are ahead of expected progress continue to be challenged and motivated. Provide them with additional tasks or stretch goals to maintain their momentum and progress.

4. **Use progress tracking and monitoring tools:** Regularly assess the progress of all students using progress tracking and monitoring tools. Identify early warning signs of students at risk of falling behind and provide support and resources in a timely manner.

5. **Encourage peer-to-peer learning and support:** Create a culture of collaboration and teamwork. Pair students who are ahead of expected progress with those who are lagging and need extra support. This will not only help the students who are lagging but also help the students who are ahead to reinforce their knowledge and skills. Suggest workshops by student that are ahead or just a little behind to help stuggling students with sections of work that the student ahead are strongest in, code/provide a booking system for these workshops.

6. **Celebrate student successes:** Recognize the hard work and effort of all students, regardless of their current progress, to create a positive and supportive learning environment. Celebrate student successes and achievements regularly.

By implementing these steps, we can help ensure that all 20 students are provided ample opportunity to complete the bootcamp successfully and achieve their goals.
